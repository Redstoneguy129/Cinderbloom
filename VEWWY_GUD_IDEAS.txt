Infernal hardship
--------------------------------------------
enlightened soulsand
will reveal a picture later
enlightened soulsand cackles and glows when you stop on it
it sucks you into the soulsand and nearby enlightened soulsand will be alerted as well and suck you in with them
[Player] Was enlightened (death message)
when broken, the block shrieks and drops a cackle of souls
this can be put into a smithing table to upgrade diamond armor
like the reverse of thorns
obsorbs most damage and lowers enemy attack speed greatly
when infused with axes, hoes, or swords, the sword's base damage in significantly decreased and when the enchanted item is equipped, it gives a new currently unnamed effect
this effect can stack up to 9x
and it increases your damage and effect multiplier the more kills you get
for Infernal hardship of course
at max (9x) multiplier, the damage that can be done if 4 more damage points than netherite weaopons
------------------------------------------------------------------
I mentioned something about lost souls on the trello
lost souls are a combination of strays and the vex
they float around aimlessly through the nether wastes and spawn frequently in the soul sand valley
they don't do anything to harm the player except make spooky sounds which i'm sure squidud can help us make
however, they lead the player with iron nuggets towards enlightened soulsand or other hostile mobs (you choose which ever you want)
if you don't want to do that, then you can try and code it so they attempt to push the player in groups towards lava blocks or towards hostile entities
-----------------------------------------------------------
gilded rose
this only spawns on enlightened soulsand and in large piglin camps. once obtained, it not only makes you safe around piglins when it is held, but nearby piglins will attempt to attack entities that have damaged the player
this does not mean the piglins are tamed and they do not follow the player
when a Gilded Rose is given to a piglin, they immediately die
--------------------------------------------------------------------
normal basalt now drops basalt shards unless broken by a silk touch pickaxe
9 basalt shards allow you to craft the basalt block once agin, which you can use to make basalt bricks and slabs and all the rest that comes witha new rock these days
------------------------------------------------------------------
bloodstone
they'd be found in a specific biome and kinda form like the rest of the nether but more sharp
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Spears
early game items for infernal hell
Enchantments include
Sharpness
Elongated Blade (increases overral melee range)
Feathered Hilt (Increases throw range)
Flame (Same effect as flame bow, but only effective when thrown)
spears are throwable
no other enchantments
Also nethermites
nether version of endermites
a combination of silverfish and endermites
they can burrow and also "melt" or otherwise teleport
they have a miniscule chance dropping magma cream when killed
they are considred an arthropod, just like ghast larvae are
-----------------------------------------------------------------
scorched
what if we added...
lava drowned
that have an 80% chance of spawning with golden spears
and have a 30% chance of dropping a spear
-----------------------------------------------------------------
lava ocean monument
with lava sponges
-----------------------------------------------------------------
how about a "lava sight" potion
that lets you see things in lava
but acts like blindness in water
brewed with infernal stalk and magma cream
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1 gilded rose
and one Red Gilded Rose
the names
the red gilded rose is a fake and kills the player immediately when held
and the gilded rose is real and does the stuff i mentioned in secret chat
Actually
call it a blood tinted rose
-----------------------------------------------------------------
demons + demon wings
Another Cinderbloom idea
demons
don't add them rn
but they'll have wings and fly and stuff
and drop demon leather
which can be crafted into simple armor and demon wings
demon wings aren't as good as an elytra, but they'll be a mid/early game item
-----------------------------------------------------------------
cinderblooms
For cinderbloom we could do actual cinderblooms like berries in the nether
-----------------------------------------------------------------
blooming petals
i have a better idea
bloooming petals
they'd spawn in a structure in lava
and hurt any entities nearby
burns the player when held
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Blackstone forge
smelts iron bars, chains, damaged anvil, cauldron, iron doors, rails, hopper, buckets, minecart to get some iron
burns player if they're nearby too long
(crafted with blackstone brick, not normal blackstone)
